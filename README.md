# Regression---Yes-Bank-Stock-Closing-Price-Prediction-Video-presentation-
# Introduction
In this project, we performed an analysis of Yes Bank's stock price data to predict the future closing prices using machine learning regression models. Through careful data processing, manipulation, and the application of a regression algorithm, we were able to generate predictions about future stock prices. The project involves a series of steps starting from data cleaning to model training and evaluation, with a final goal of making predictions based on historical data.

For a better understanding of the entire process, a video presentation has been created, showcasing key steps and findings of the analysis.

# Purpose
The purpose of this project was to develop a predictive model for Yes Bank's stock closing price using regression techniques. The key objectives of the project were:

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Handle missing values, duplicates, and incorrect data types.
Feature Engineering: Create new features like average price and volume for better model performance.
Data Visualization: Utilize graphs and charts to visualize trends, correlations, and insights from the data.
Stock Price Prediction: Apply machine learning regression models to predict future closing prices based on historical data.
This project serves as a useful tool for anyone interested in understanding stock price movements and for financial analysts who wish to predict stock trends based on past performance.

# Business Context
Stock price prediction plays an essential role in the financial sector for investors, traders, and analysts. Being able to forecast stock prices can help businesses and individuals make informed decisions about buying, selling, or holding stock.

In a highly volatile market, accurately predicting future stock prices based on past data and trends can provide a competitive edge and assist with risk management strategies.

# Methodology
The methodology for this analysis involved several key steps:

Data Collection:

The dataset used in this project contains historical stock prices of Yes Bank, including daily closing prices, volume, and other stock-related metrics.
Data Preprocessing:

Handling Missing Values: Checked and handled missing values in the dataset.
Removing Duplicates: Ensured the dataset is clean by removing any duplicate entries.
Data Type Checks: Verified and adjusted data types where necessary to ensure proper analysis.
Feature Engineering:

Created average price (average of high and low prices) and volume as additional features to improve the prediction accuracy of the model.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualized trends, patterns, and correlations in the stock data through graphs such as line plots, scatter plots, and histograms.
This step helped in understanding the behavior of the stock price over time and identifying any key patterns or trends.
Model Training:

Applied various regression models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest Regression) to predict the stock’s closing price.
Split the dataset into training and test sets to train the model and evaluate its performance.
Model Evaluation:

Evaluated the model’s performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared.
Chose the best-performing model based on its ability to generalize and make accurate predictions.
Prediction:

Generated predicted stock closing prices for future periods based on the historical data and the chosen model.
Video Presentation:

A video presentation was created to explain the entire process of data cleaning, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation, with visual demonstrations of key findings and predictions.
# Key Insights
The analysis revealed the following insights:

Data Trends: Stock price movements over time showed clear trends that can be used for making predictions.
Volume and Price Correlation: There was a notable correlation between trading volume and stock price fluctuations.
Prediction Accuracy: The regression model was able to make reasonable predictions for future closing prices, with some degree of error.
Feature Importance: Certain features like average price and volume had significant importance in predicting stock price changes.

# Tools & Technologies Used
Python: For data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.
Pandas & NumPy: For data manipulation and analysis.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization and plotting.
Scikit-learn: For implementing machine learning models and evaluation metrics.
Jupyter Notebook: For running and documenting the analysis.

Conclusion
This project provides an effective analysis of Yes Bank’s stock closing prices using regression techniques. The predictive model developed allows us to forecast future stock prices based on historical data, providing valuable insights for investors and analysts in the finance industry.

By understanding trends and correlations in the stock data, businesses can make more informed decisions about their investments and risk management strategies.

# Future Work
